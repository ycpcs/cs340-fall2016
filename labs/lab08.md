# Your task

Work on [Practice Exam 1](../practice/cs340-fall2015-exam01.pdf).

Some specific questions I would suggest working on include:

* Question 2 (construct a DFA)
* Question 5 (convert a DFA to an NFA)
* Question 6 (construct a CFG)
* Question 7 (derive a string and construct a parse tree)
* Question 8 (recursive descent parse function)
* Question 9 (construct a Turing Machine)

I would be happy to check your work, and you can also refer to the [Solution](../practice/cs340-fall2015-exam01-solution.pdf).
